I'm Senior Infrastructure Engineer. 14+ years of experience specializing in server administrations, infrastructure automation, and virtualization. Over the past years, I have been spending my time and developing skills in IT automatization. I always try to find a better problem-solving method for challenging tasks and learning new technologies and tools if the need arises.
